It's possible to [check the status of your transaction](/how-to/sending/checking-the-status-of-a-transaction) right from your MyCrypto interface, by either going to Tools > Check Transaction Status in the sidebar, or by clicking the ">" button next to any transaction in the Recent Transactions overview, at the bottom of your dashboard.
